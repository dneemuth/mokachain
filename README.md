A decentralized storage framework implementing client-side encryption that would allow users for time stamping and fingerprinting any data objects, files and streams.
The removal of central controls would mitigate most traditional data failures and outages, as well as significantly increase security, privacy, and data control. Peer-to-peer networks are generally unfeasible for production storage systems, as data availability is a function of popularity, rather than utility. We propose a solution in the form of verification and reward system to encourage data storing. In this way we can periodically check data integrity, and offer rewards to peers maintaining data. We further propose a model for addressing access and performance concerns with a set of independent or federated nodes.
